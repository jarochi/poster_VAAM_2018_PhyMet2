	abstract = {The Subcommittee for Taxonomy of Methanogenic Bacteria has agreed in principle on minimum requirements for the description of new taxa of methanogenic bacteria. These requirements, as well as methods for determining specified characteristics, are indicated here and are proposed as minimal standards for the taxonomic description of new taxa of methanogens. The specified phenotypic characteristics are often not sufficient to distinguish among taxa or to determine the phylogenetic placement of a taxon, and, in these cases, additional chemotaxonomic, molecular, or genetic data may be required. The placement of a new taxon should be consistent with phylogeny, usually based on tests such as nucleic acid sequencing or cataloging studies or on protein fingerprinting. Suggestions are welcome for the improvement of these requirements, which are tentative until given final approval by the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {We introduce the C++ application and R package ranger. The software is a fast implementation of random forests for high dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression and survival trees are supported. We describe the implementation, provide examples, validate the package with a reference implementation, and compare runtime and memory usage with other implementations. The new software proves to scale best with the number of features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting. Finally, we show that ranger is the fastest and most memory efficient implementation of random forests to analyze data on the scale of a genome-wide association study.},
