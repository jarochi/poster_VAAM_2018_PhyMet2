	abstract = {The methanogenic archaea are a group of micro-organisms that have developed a unique metabolic pathway for obtaining energy. There are 150 characterized species in this group; however, novel species continue to be discovered. Since methanogens are considered a crucial part of the carbon cycle in the anaerobic ecosystem, characterization of these micro-organisms is important for understanding anaerobic ecology. A methanogens database (MDB; http://metanogen.biotech.uni.wroc.pl/), including physiological and biochemical characteristics of methanogens, was constructed based on the descriptions of isolated type strains. Analysis of the data revealed that methanogens are able to grow from 0 to 122 °C. Methanogens growing at the same temperature may have very different growth rates. There is no clear correlation between the optimal growth temperature and the DNA G+C content. The following substrate preferences are observed in the database: 74.5\% of archaea species utilize H2+CO2, 33\% utilize methyl compounds and 8.5\% utilize acetate. Utilization of methyl compounds (mainly micro-organisms belonging to the genera Methanosarcina and Methanolobus ) is seldom accompanied by an ability to utilize H2+CO2. Very often, data for described species are incomplete, especially substrate preferences. Additional research leading to completion of missing information and development of standards, especially for substrate utilization, would be very helpful.},
